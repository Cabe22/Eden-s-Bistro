## Objective
The purpose of the Eden's Bistro Web Application is to feature the use of PHP to bring information from a database to a live website. On the website, users can view information about the restaurant, such as the menu, restaurant events, and reservable spaces. The website also allows employees to go in and add menu items, events, and reservable spaces.

### Bugs/Issues
- Log=in page does not check/validate for correct login information.
- Footer on Home page is different from the other pages.


### Upcoming Features
- Payment button on the right of the navigation bar will become a 'Order Now' button.
